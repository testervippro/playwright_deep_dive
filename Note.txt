What is storageState in Playwright?
storageState is a file path where Playwright stores the browser context’s state — including:

✅ Cookies (like auth session cookies)

✅ Local storage (if your app uses it to store login or preferences)

✅ Session storage (if applicable)

This is especially useful to reuse an already logged-in session across multiple tests without logging in again every time.

npx playwright test --project=chrome  if ignore --project=chrome  it will run all brower or commment in to project in playwright.config.ts
